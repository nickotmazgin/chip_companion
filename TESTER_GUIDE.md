# Chip Companion - Tester Guide

Quick reference for testing BLE, NFC, and manual entry flows.

---

## Test Environment Setup

### What You Need
- **Android:** Physical device with NFC and/or Bluetooth (Android 10+)
- **iOS:** Physical device with NFC and/or Bluetooth (iOS 13+)
- **Optional:** BLE pet microchip scanner (for full BLE testing)
- **Optional:** NFC pet microchip tag (for full NFC testing)

### Without Hardware
You can still test the app using **manual entry mode**:
- Open app ‚Üí Home screen
- Enter test chip IDs in the text field
- Tap "Validate"

## Test Chip IDs

Use these sample IDs to test format validation:

### ‚úÖ Valid IDs

| Format | Test ID | Expected Result |
|--------|---------|----------------|

| **10-digit AVID** | `1234567890` | AVID 10-digit, shows AVID registry |
| **9-digit Legacy** | `123456789` | Legacy 9-digit, shows multiple registries |
| **15-char Hex** | `3039F2A456789BC` | ISO-like (Hex), offers decimal conversion |

### ‚ùå Invalid IDs

| Test Input | Expected Result |
|------------|----------------|
| `12345` | "Invalid format" message |
| `abcdefghij` | "Invalid format" message |
| `982-000-12345` | "Invalid format" (hyphens not supported) |

2. **DENY** the "Nearby devices" permission prompt
3. **Expected:** Clear error message, scan does NOT start

**Android 10-11 BLE Test:**
1. Open app ‚Üí Devices ‚Üí Scan for Bluetooth
2. **DENY** the "Location" permission prompt
3. **Expected:** Clear error message explaining why location is needed

**iOS NFC Test:**
1. First time tapping NFC scan
2. **DENY** the NFC permission
3. **Expected:** Clear error, does not crash

## Testing Checklist

Use this for systematic testing before release:

### Core Functionality
- [ ] Manual chip ID entry works (test all valid formats)
- [ ] Invalid IDs show proper error messages
- [ ] Registry links open in browser
- [ ] Language switching works for all 5 languages

### NFC (if available)
- [ ] NFC scan reads chip ID
- [ ] Permission prompt shows (iOS first time)
- [ ] Denial handled gracefully
- [ ] NFC disabled shows clear message

### Bluetooth (if available)
- [ ] BLE scan requests correct permission (SDK-specific)
- [ ] Permission denial shows clear message
- [ ] BT disabled shows clear message
- [ ] Scanner connection works (if hardware available)

### IAP (iOS)
- [ ] "Restore Purchases" button visible
- [ ] Restore works for existing purchases
- [ ] Purchase flow completes successfully

### Edge Cases
- [ ] App works in airplane mode (offline validation)
- [ ] App works with all permissions denied (manual entry only)
- [ ] App doesn't crash when backgrounded during scan
- [ ] Multiple rapid scans don't cause issues

---

## Performance Expectations

- App launch: < 2 seconds
- Validation: < 100ms (offline, instant)
- BLE scan: 4-10 seconds timeout
- NFC scan: 1-3 seconds after tag tap
