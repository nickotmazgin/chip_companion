# Privacy Policy

Effective Date: 2025-09-27
Application: Chip Companion

## Overview

Chip Companion is a professional offline microchip validation tool and registry directory. It does not collect, transmit, sell, or share personal data. All functionality (format validation, registry directory, scanning features) runs locally on the device.

## Data We Collect

We intentionally design the app to avoid personal data collection. The only stored information is:

- Language / localization preference (saved locally using platform key–value storage)
- Pro purchase status (saved locally to enable Pro features)

## Data We Absolutely Do NOT Collect

- Pet identification numbers or results
- Scanned microchip IDs or chip data
- Registry search history
- Device identifiers or fingerprints
- Biometric data
- Voice recordings
- Camera access
- Microphone access
- Location services
- Names, emails, phone numbers
- Pet owner data or pet identity records
- Microchip registration ownership details
- Usage analytics, crash analytics, advertising identifiers
- Account registrations or authentication tokens
- Bluetooth device data or connection logs
- NFC tag data or scanning history

## Scanner Data Handling

- **Bluetooth Scanning**: When using Bluetooth scanners, scanned chip IDs are processed locally for format validation only
- **NFC Scanning**: When using NFC scanning, tag data is read and processed locally for format validation only
- **No Data Storage**: Scanned microchip IDs are never stored, saved, or transmitted
- **Immediate Processing**: All scanning data is used for immediate validation and then discarded
- **Local Only**: All scanner functionality operates entirely on the user's device
- **No Cloud Sync**: Scanned data is never uploaded to any servers or cloud services

## Network & Connectivity

- The app does not call external APIs.
- No remote logging or telemetry.
- Links the user taps (e.g., registry websites) open via system browser; we do not monitor that activity.
- External website access is user-initiated and controlled by the user's browser.

## Legal Basis & International Compliance

### GDPR Compliance (European Union)

Because no personal data is processed, explicit consent, legitimate interest assessment, or data processing agreements are not required. Local preference storage is a device-level functional setting only.

### PIPEDA Compliance (Canada)

This app complies with Canada's Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act by design - no personal information is collected, used, or disclosed.

### CCPA Compliance (California, USA)

The California Consumer Privacy Act does not apply to this app as no personal information is collected, sold, or shared.

### Additional International Compliance

- **Australia Privacy Act 1988**: Compliant by design (no personal information handling)
- **Israel Privacy Protection Law**: Compliant (no personal data processing)
- **Brazil LGPD**: Compliant (no personal data processing)

## Children's Privacy (Enhanced COPPA Compliance)

This app is safe for all ages. No personal information is collected from users of any age.

## In-App Purchases

- **Purchase Processing**: In-app purchases are processed by Apple (iOS) and Google (Android) through their respective app stores
- **Payment Information**: We do not collect, store, or have access to your payment information
- **Purchase Status**: Only the Pro feature unlock status is stored locally on your device
- **No Personal Data**: Purchase transactions are handled entirely by the app store platforms

## Third Parties

No SDKs, analytics, ad networks, or crash reporters are integrated. In-app purchase processing is handled by Apple App Store and Google Play Store.

## Third-Party Trademarks

When you view registry information, you see publicly available contact details. We do not share your usage with these organizations.

## Security

- No remote endpoints = minimal attack surface.
- Input (chip ID text) is sanitized in-memory only and not persisted.
- Uninstalling the app removes all locally stored preferences automatically.

## Data Retention

Only the language preference is stored locally until:

- The user changes it, or
- The app is uninstalled (which removes it automatically).

## Your Rights

Because no personal data is collected or stored, rights such as access, rectification, deletion, portability, or objection are inherently satisfied (no data exists to act upon).

If you have questions about this policy or wish to exercise any rights, you may contact us through the methods listed below, though no personal data exists to act upon.

## Changes to This Policy

If functionality changes to include any data processing, this policy will be updated and a new effective date will be shown here.

## Contact

For questions or concerns, open an issue in the official repository or contact the developer via the distribution platform listing.

Plain-language summary: We don’t collect or send any personal information. The app works entirely offline except when you manually open external registry links in your browser.
