# 🛟 Chip Companion Support

Need help with Chip Companion? Here's how to get support.

## 🧪 Closed Test Support

### Testing Guide
👉 **[Complete Tester Guide](docs/testers.md)** – Step-by-step instructions for joining the test, installing, and providing feedback.

### Common Questions

**Q: How do I join the closed test?**  
A: Email `NickOtmazgin.Dev@gmail.com` with subject "Chip Companion Tester", then opt-in via the [Google Play Testing Program](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.chipcompanion.app.chip_companion).

**Q: The app says "not available in your country". What do I do?**  
A: The closed test may be region-locked. Email the developer to request access for your region.

**Q: How do I restore my Pro purchase?**  
A: Go to **Devices** → Tap the Pro unlock dialog → Tap **Restore Purchases**. Make sure you're signed in with the same Google account used for the original purchase.

**Q: Why can't I scan my pet's microchip with NFC?**  
A: Implanted microchips use 134.2 kHz RFID, which is **not** the same as NFC (13.56 MHz). You need a dedicated microchip scanner. The app's NFC feature is for scanning NDEF tags (collars, cards) that encode chip IDs in text/URL format.

**Q: Does Chip Companion connect to live registry databases?**  
A: No. Chip Companion is 100% offline and provides a **directory** of registry contact information. To look up a chip in a live database, visit the registry's website or call them directly.
