Chip Companion - Pet Microchip Validator
================================================================================

Copy-paste these justifications into the Play Console when prompted about 
each permission.

================================================================================
BLUETOOTH_CONNECT
================================================================================

Used to establish connections with external Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) pet 
microchip scanners. This allows the app to receive scanned chip data from 
compatible scanning hardware. All processing is done locally on the device; 
no data is transmitted to external servers.


================================================================================
BLUETOOTH_SCAN (with neverForLocation flag)
================================================================================

Used to discover nearby Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) pet microchip scanners 
for pairing. The neverForLocation flag is set because this app does NOT use 
Bluetooth for location purposes.

Scanning is used solely to identify compatible scanner devices for chip 
validation. On Android 11 and lower (SDK ≤30), ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION is 
required by the Android platform for BLE discovery, but it is not used for 
location tracking or position determination.

All scanned data is processed locally; no data is stored or transmitted.


================================================================================
ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION (maxSdkVersion="30")
================================================================================

This permission is ONLY requested on Android 11 and lower (SDK ≤30) as a 
platform requirement for Bluetooth Low Energy device discovery. On Android 12+ 
(SDK 31+), this permission is NOT requested at all.

This app does NOT use this permission for location tracking, geolocation, or 
any location-based features. The sole purpose is to enable BLE scanner 
discovery on older Android versions.

All microchip validation is performed offline and locally. No location data 
is collected, stored, or transmitted.


================================================================================
NFC
================================================================================

Used to read Near Field Communication (NFC) tags containing pet microchip 
identifiers. The app validates chip format and displays registry information. 
All processing is done locally; no data is transmitted to external servers.


================================================================================
ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE
================================================================================

Used to check network availability before allowing optional external lookups 
via URL launcher (opens external browser). The app does NOT make direct 
network requests; all network access is through the user's browser via 
url_launcher.

This permission helps provide a better user experience by detecting if a 
network connection is available before attempting to open a registry lookup 
URL.

STORE LISTING - SHORT DESCRIPTION
================================================================================

Professional pet microchip validator with offline format checking for 
veterinarians, shelters, and pet owners. Supports ISO, AVID, and legacy 
formats. No data collection.


================================================================================
STORE LISTING - FULL DESCRIPTION (EXCERPT)
================================================================================

Chip Companion is a professional offline pet microchip validator designed 
for veterinarians, animal shelters, rescue organizations, and pet owners.

✓ Offline validation (no internet required)
✓ Supports ISO 11784/11785, AVID 10-digit, and legacy 9-digit formats
✓ Compatible with Bluetooth and NFC scanners
✓ No data collection or telemetry
✓ No ads, no tracking, fully private

HOW IT WORKS:
1. Scan chip using NFC or paired Bluetooth scanner
2. App validates format and identifies chip standard
3. View registry suggestions for chip registration lookup
4. Optionally open registry websites in your browser

PRIVACY:
All microchip validation is performed locally on your device. The app does 
NOT collect, store, or transmit any personal data. No analytics or tracking.

BLUETOOTH & NFC:
- Bluetooth: Connect to external BLE pet microchip scanners
- NFC: Read NDEF tags containing chip IDs
- Location permission (Android ≤11 only): Required by Android OS for BLE 
  discovery; NOT used for location tracking

PROFESSIONAL USE:
Ideal for veterinary clinics, animal shelters, rescue groups, and 
professional pet services needing quick chip format verification.

NOTES FOR APP REVIEW
================================================================================

TESTING INSTRUCTIONS:
The app can be fully tested without physical scanner hardware by manually 
entering test chip IDs on the home screen:

Test IDs:
• 15-digit ISO: 982000123456789
• 10-digit AVID: 1234567890
• 9-digit legacy: 123456789

The app will validate format, display chip type, and show registry suggestions.

PERMISSIONS:
• Bluetooth: Used only for connecting to external BLE scanners; no location 
  tracking
• NFC: Used only for reading NDEF chip tags
• Network State: Used only to check connectivity before opening external 
  URLs in browser

NO INTERNET PERMISSION:
This app does NOT request the INTERNET permission. All lookups are performed 
by launching the user's external browser (via url_launcher).

PRIVACY:
No data collection, no analytics, no telemetry. Fully offline processing.
