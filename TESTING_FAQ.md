# Testing FAQ

**NFC toggle missing?** Your device may not support NFC or it's disabled in system settings.  
**Bluetooth scan disabled?** Turn on Bluetooth and grant scan permissions.  
**Tablet not listed?** Some legacy tablets lack "location" hardware; we mark location features optional to keep eligibility.  
**Where is my version?** Settings → App Information (e.g., `2.0.7 (11)`).  
**Translate text?** Use the Feedback Form → "Translation" section.
